![Queue vs Stack](/cover.jpg "Queue vs Stack")

This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["Queue vs. Stack in C#"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/queue-vs-stack-in-c-2f75efe907d5). This post and repository focus on understanding the differences between queues and stacks in C#, their use cases, and when to choose one over the other.

## Overview
In this blog post, I discuss the fundamental differences between queues and stacks, two essential data structures in programming. Each structure is explained with code examples to demonstrate their unique behaviors and applications.

### Topics Covered

- **Definition of Stack**  
  A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

- **Definition of Queue**  
  A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

- **Key Operations**  
  - **Stack**: `Push`, `Pop`, `Peek`
  - **Queue**: `Enqueue`, `Dequeue`, `Peek`

- **Use Cases**  
  Discuss scenarios where stacks and queues are most effective, such as:
  - Stacks for function calls, backtracking algorithms, and undo mechanisms.
  - Queues for scheduling tasks, breadth-first search, and managing requests.

## How to Use
1. **Read the Blog Post**: Start by reading the full blog post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/queue-vs-stack-in-c-2f75efe907d5).
2. **Explore Code Samples**: Review the repository for code examples demonstrating both stacks and queues in C#.
3. **Practice Implementing**: Use the provided examples to practice implementing queues and stacks in your own C# projects.
